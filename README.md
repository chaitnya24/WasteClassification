### Week-1
- Uploaded the data set.
- Used cv2 and Matplotlib to conduct data analysis.

### Week-2
- Check the understanding of the model by randomly calling and labeling some images form the data set to see whether the labeling was being done correctly.
- Created the CNN model and constructed all the layers of the model.
- Completed the training and testing part of the model devlopement, Ran 10 epochs for the increased accuracy of the model.

### Week-3
- Plotted the Graph for the training and validation accuracy.
- Plotted the Graph for the training and validation loss.
- Tested the Model by giving it various images of both recyclable and organic waste(the images used were both from within and outside of the dataset).
